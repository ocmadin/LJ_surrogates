# LJ_surrogates

Drivers used to prepare parameter sets, process data inputs, build surrogates and run optimizations are found in `LJ_surrogates`.
Specific files used to set up experiments in the paper are found in `projects/pure-only/integrated` and `projects/mixture-only`.
Data files containing the output of all simulations (i.e. force fields and physical property calculation results) used in the optimization, as well any relevant benchmarking outputs, can be found in `data`
